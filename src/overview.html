    <P>WebGraph is a framework to study the web graph. It provides simple ways to manage
	very large graphs, exploiting modern compression techniques. More precisely,
	it is currently made of:
	<OL>

	<LI>A set of simple codes, called <em>&zeta; codes</em>, which are
	particularly suitable for storing web graphs (or, in general, integers
	with a power-law distribution in a certain exponent range).

	<LI>Algorithms for compressing web graphs that exploit gap compression and
	differential compression (<i>&agrave; la</i> <A
	HREF="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/randall01link.html">LINK</A>),
	intervalisation and &zeta; codes to provide a high compression ratio (see <A HREF="http://law.dsi.unimi.it/datasets.php">our datasets</A>). The
	algorithms are controlled by several parameters, which provide
	different tradeoffs between access speed and compression ratio.

	<LI>Algorithms for accessing a compressed graph without actually decompressing it,
	using lazy techniques that delay the decompression until it is actually necessary.

	<LI>This package, providing a complete, documented implementation of
	the algorithms above in Java. It is <A
	 HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</A>
	 distributed under the <A
	 HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"><ACRONYM TITLE="GNU's not
	 Unix">GNU</ACRONYM> General Public License</A>.

	<LI>Data sets for very large graph (e.g., a billion of links). These are either 
	gathered from public sources (such as <A HREF="http://www-diglib.stanford.edu/~testbed/doc2/WebBase/">WebBase</A>),
	or gathered by <A HREF="http://law.dsi.unimi.it/software.php#ubicrawler">UbiCrawler</A>.

	</OL>
	
	<P>In the end, with WebGraph you can access and analyse very large web graphs. Using WebGraph is as easy as installing a few
	jar files and downloading a data set. This makes studying phenomena such as PageRank, distribution of
	graph properties of the web graph, etc., very easy.

	<p>You are welcome to use and improve WebGraph! If you find our software useful for your research, please quote 
	our paper &ldquo;<a href="http://vigna.dsi.unimi.it/papers.php#BoVWFI">The WebGraph Framework I: Compression Techniques</a>&rdquo;, by Paolo Boldi and
   Sebastiano Vigna, in <i>Proc&#46; of the Thirteenth World&ndash;Wide Web
   Conference</i>, pages 595&minus;601, 2004, ACM Press.
  
   <h2>Looking around</h2>

	<p><strong>Warning</strong>: WebGraph 2+ is not fully compatible with previous versions and
	requires some minor code refactoring. Please
	refer to the documentation of {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.ImmutableGraph}.

    	<P>For in-depth information on the Webgraph framework, you should have
    	a look at its <A HREF="http://webgraph.dsi.unimi.it/">home page</A>,
      where you can find some papers about the compression techniques it uses.
      Datasets are available at the <a href="http://law.dsi.unimi.it/">
      <acronym title="Laboratory for Web Algorithmics">LAW</acronym> web site</a>.

      	<P>The classes of interest for the casual Webgraph user are {@link
      	it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.ImmutableGraph}, which specifies the access
      	methods for an immutable graph, {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.BVGraph},
      	which allow to retrieve or recompress a graph stored in the format
      	described in <a
      	href="http://vigna.dsi.unimi.it/papers.php#BoVWFI"><i>The WebGraph
      	Framework I: Compression Techniques</i></a>, and {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.Transform}, which
      	provides several ways to transform an {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.ImmutableGraph}.

			<p>If you plan on building your graphs dynamically, the class
			{@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.ArrayListMutableGraph} makes it possible
			to create incrementally a graph and then extract an {@linkplain
			it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.ArrayListMutableGraph#immutableView() immutable view}.

        <P>The package {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.examples} contains useful
        examples that show how to access sequentially and randomly an immutable
        graph.

	<h2>Importing your data</h2>

	<p>If you want to import your own data into WebGraph, you must write
	an implementation of {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.ImmutableGraph} that
	exposes your data. A simple example is given in {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.examples.IntegerListImmutableGraph},
	a stub class exposing a simple, noncompressed binary format as an {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.ImmutableGraph}.
	Once your data is exposed in that way, you can get a compressed version
	using the <code>store()</code> method of your class of interest. Often, there
	is a main method (see, e.g., {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.BVGraph}) that
	will load your class and invoke <code>store()</code> for you.

	<p>As an alternative, the class {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.ASCIIGraph}
	can be used to read graphs specified in a very simple ASCII format. The class
	implements {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.ASCIIGraph#loadOnce(java.io.InputStream)} so
	that the file can be just piped into a class offering a main method that supports
	<code>loadOnce()</code> (e.g., {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.BVGraph}).
	You can also generate a graph in ASCII format and read it using
	{@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.ASCIIGraph#loadOffline(CharSequence)}&mdash;the
	graph will not be loaded into main memory.
	
	<p>{@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.ASCIIGraph} requires listing the successors of each
	node on a separate line. If your graph is specified arc by arc (one arc per line) you
	can use {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.ArcListASCIIGraph} instead. 
	{@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.ShiftedByOneArcListASCIIGraph} can be used if your input
	data numbers (rather insensibly) nodes starting from one.
	
	<h2>Importing your <em>labelled</em> data</h2>
	
	<p>Arc-labelled graphs are represented using implementations of {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.labelling.ArcLabelledImmutableGraph}.
	Most arc-labelled graphs are based on an underlying {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.ImmutableGraph}, and
	the {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.labelling.ArcLabelledImmutableGraph} implementation just provides
	label handling. The example {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.examples.IntegerTriplesArcLabelledImmutableGraph}
	shows how to expose your data as an instance of {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.labelling.ArcLabelledImmutableGraph},
	so you can save your data using your preferred combination of implementations.
	
      <h2>Dependencies</h2>

    <P>WebGraph requires Java &ge;6 and relies on <A HREF="http://fastutil.dsi.unimi.it/">fastutil</A> 6.4 or greater
	for high-performance containers and algorithms, 
		on the <a HREF="http://dsd.lbl.gov/~hoschek/colt/">COLT
	distribution</a> for statistics, on the <A
	HREF="http://dsiutils.dsi.unimi.it/">DSI utilities</A> for bit-level I/O, on
	<A HREF="http://sux.dsi.unimi.it/">Sux4J</A> for succinct data structures, on <A
	HREF="http://www.martiansoftware.com/jsap/">JSAP</A> for line-command parsing and on
   <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">log4j</a> for logging.
	
	<p>Note that in principle the DSI utilities depend on a number of additional useful libraries from 
	the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/">Jakarta commons project</a>, 
    including <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/collections/">collections</a>,
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/lang/">lang</a>,
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/configuration/">configuration</a> and
