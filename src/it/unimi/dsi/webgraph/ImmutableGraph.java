/** A simple abstract class representing an immutable graph.
 *
 * <P><STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: in WebGraph 2.0 the iterator architecture has been
 * made fully lazy to achieve greater speed. The current implementation of this class
 * uses {@link LazyIntIterator lazy integer iterators} and is thus incompatible with
 * previous versions (which were using {@link IntIterator}). 
 * The {@link LazyIntIterators#eager(LazyIntIterator)} factory method can
 * be used to turn lazy iterators into eager ones for easier refactoring, but we suggest
 * some idioms that are significantly more efficient. Please read below.
 *
 * <P>Subclasses of this class are used to create and access <em>immutable graphs</em>, that is,
 * graphs that are computed once for all, stored conveniently, and then accessed repeatedly.
 * Moreover, immutable graphs are usually very large&mdash;so large that two such graphs may not
 * fit into central memory (the main example being a sizable portion of the web).
 *
 * <P>A subclass of this class must implement methods to obtain the {@linkplain
 * #numNodes() number of nodes}, the {@linkplain #outdegree(int) outdegree of a
 * node} and the successors of a node (either {@link #successors(int)}
 * or {@link #successorArray(int)}). Additionally, it may provide methods to
 * obtain the {@linkplain #numNodes() number of arcs}, and a {@linkplain #basename() basename}.
 *
 * <P>This class provides {@link #equals(Object)} and {@link #hashCode()} methods that consider
 * two graph equals if they have the same size and all their successor lists are equal.
 *  
 * <H2>Iterating on successors</H2>
 * 
 * <p>Starting with WebGraph 2.0, the iterator architecture is <em>fully lazy</em>&mdash;you have no
 * <code>hasNext()</code> method. Rather, the {@link LazyIntIterator} returned by {@link #successors(int)}
 * will return -1 when no more successors are available. The idiomatic forms for enumerating successors
 * <it>via</it> iterators are
 * <pre>
 * LazyIntIterator successors = g.successors( x );
 * int d = g.outdegree( x );
 * while( d-- != 0 ) doSomething( successors.nextInt() );
 * </pre>
 * and
 * <pre>
 * LazyIntIterator successors = g.successors( x );
 * int t;
 * while( ( t = successors.nextInt() ) != -1 ) doSomething( t );
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>The alternative method {@link #successorArray(int)} provides an array containing the successors
 * <em>and possibly more elements</em>. Use {@link #outdegree(int)} to know how many elements are valid.
 * The efficiency of {@link #successors(int)} and {@link #successorArray(int)} may vary depending on the
 * implementation.
 *  
 * <H2>Refactoring for WebGraph 2+</H2>
 * 
 * <p>If you want to refactor code using an older version of WebGraph for WebGraph 2+, there is a trivial way:
 * each call to {@link #successors(int)} must be wrapped into an eager (i.e., Java standard) iterator. If your
 * code was something like
 * <pre>
 * IntIterator successors = g.successors( x );
 * while( successors.hasNext() ) doSomething( successors.nextInt() );
 * </pre>
 * it is sufficient to modify it as follows:
 * <pre>
 * IntIterator successors = LazyIntIterators.eager( g.successors( x ) );
 * while( successors.hasNext() ) doSomething( successors.nextInt() );
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>If, however, you where not using <code>hasNext()</code>, but rather the first idiomatic
 * form described above, changing the type of <code>successors</code> to {@link LazyIntIterator} will do the job.
 * 
 * 
 * <H2>Building an immutable graph</H2> 
 *
 * <P>Due to their large size, immutable
 * graphs have a peculiar serialisation scheme. Every subclass of this class
 * <strong>must</strong> implement a number of static methods that create an immutable
 * graph, given a string (usually a basename for a set of files) and, optionally, a {@link it.unimi.dsi.logging.ProgressLogger}.
 * The signatures that <strong>must</strong> be implemented are 
 * <UL>
 * <LI><code>ImmutableGraph load(CharSequence, ProgressLogger)</code>;
 * <LI><code>ImmutableGraph load(CharSequence)</code>;
 * <LI><code>ImmutableGraph loadSequential(CharSequence, ProgressLogger)</code>;
 * <LI><code>ImmutableGraph loadSequential(CharSequence)</code>;
 * <LI><code>ImmutableGraph loadOffline(CharSequence, ProgressLogger)</code>;
 * <LI><code>ImmutableGraph loadOffline(CharSequence)</code>.
 * <LI><code>ImmutableGraph loadOnce(InputStream)</code>;
 * </UL>
 * 
 * <p>Additionally, the following signatures <strong>can</strong> be implemented:
 * <UL>
 * <LI><code>ImmutableGraph loadMapped(CharSequence, ProgressLogger)</code>;
 * <LI><code>ImmutableGraph loadMapped(CharSequence)</code>;
 * </UL>
 *  
 * <P>The special semantics associated with <code>loadSequential()</code> is that the graph should be loaded
 * in a particular compact form that just allows sequential access. The special semantics associated to <code>loadOffline()</code> 
 * is that the immutable graph should be set up, and possibly some metadata could be read from disk, but no
 * actual data is loaded into memory; the class should guarantee that offline sequential access (i.e., by means
 * of {@link #nodeIterator(int)}) is still possible. In other words, in most cases {@link #nodeIterator(int)} will have to be
 * overridden by the subclasses to behave properly even in an offline setting (see {@link #nodeIterator()}).
 * The special semantics associated with <code>loadOnce()</code> is that the graph can be traversed
 * <em>just once</em> using a call to {@link #nodeIterator()}. The special semantics associated with <code>loadMapped()</code>
 * is that metadata could be read from disk, but the graph will be accessed by memory mapping; the class
 * should guarantee that random access is possible. 
 * 
 * <P>Note that a simple class may just implement all special forms of graph loading delegating to the standard
 * load method (see, e.g., {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.ASCIIGraph}).
 * Specific implementations of {@link ImmutableGraph} may also decide to expose internal load methods
 * to make it easier to write load methods for subclasses 
 * (see, e.g., {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.BVGraph#loadInternal(CharSequence, int, ProgressLogger) loadInternal()}).
 *
 * <P>Analogously, a subclass of this class <strong>may</strong> also implement
 * <UL>
 * <LI><code>store(ImmutableGraph, CharSequence, ProgressLogger)</code>;
 * <LI><code>store(ImmutableGraph, CharSequence)</code>.
 * </UL> 
 * 
 * These methods must store in compressed form a given immutable graph, using the default values
 * for compression parameters, etc. It is likely, however, that more 
 * of <code>store</code> methods are available, as parameters vary wildly
 * from subclass to subclass. The method {@link #store(Class, ImmutableGraph, CharSequence, ProgressLogger)}
 * invokes by reflection the methods above on the provided class.
 *
 * <P>The standard method to build a new immutable graph is creating a (possibly anonymous) class
 * that extends this class, and save it using a concrete subclass (e.g., {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.BVGraph}). See
 * the source of {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.Transform} for several examples.
 * 
 * <H2>Properties Conventions</H2>
 * 
 * <P>To provide a simple way to load an immutable graph without knowing in advance its class,
 * the following convention may be followed: a graph with basename <var><samp>name</samp></var> may feature
 * a Java property file <samp><var>name</var>.properties</samp> with a property <samp>graphclass</samp>
 * containing the actual class of the graph. In this case, you can use the implementation of the load/store
 * methods contained in this class, similarly to the standard Java serialisation scheme. {@link BVGraph}, for instance,
 * follows this convention, but {@link ASCIIGraph} does not.
 * 
 * <P>The reason why this convention is not enforced is that it is sometimes useful to write lightweight classes,
 * mostly for debugging purposes, whose graph representation is entirely contained in a single file (e.g., {@link ASCIIGraph}),
 * so that {@link #loadOnce(InputStream)} can be easily implemented.
 * 
 * <H2>Facilities for loading an immutable graph</H2>
 * 
 * <P>{@link ImmutableGraph} provides ready-made implementations of the load methods that work as follows: they
 * opens a property file with the given basename, and look for the <samp>graphclass</samp> property; then, they simply
 * delegates the actual load to the specified graph class by reflection.
 * 
 * <h2>Thread-safety and flyweight copies</h2>
 * 
 * <p>Implementations of this class need not be thread-safe. However, they implement the
 * {@link FlyweightPrototype} pattern: the {@link #copy()} method is
 * thread-safe and will return a lightweight copy of the graph&mdash;usually, all immutable
 * data will be shared between copies. Concurrent access to different copies is safe.
 * 
 * <p>Note that by contract {@link #copy()} is guaranteed to work only if {@link #randomAccess()}
 * returns true.
