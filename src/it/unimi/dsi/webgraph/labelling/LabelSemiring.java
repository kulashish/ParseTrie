/** A semiring used to compose labels. 
 * <p>When {@linkplain Transform#compose(it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.ImmutableGraph, it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.ImmutableGraph) composing}
 * two labelled graphs, we need a way to combine labels along a path, and a way to combine labels from different
 * paths connecting two nodes. These two operations are implemented by
 * {@link #multiply(Label, Label)} and {@link #add(Label, Label)}. The name of the two
 * methods are due to the fact that their operations must define a <em>semiring</em>
 * for which you must also provide a {@link #zero()} and a {@link #one()}. For instance,
 * if a graph is labelled with weights, a semiring implementing {@link #multiply(Label, Label)} by
 * a standard sum and {@link #add(Label, Label)} using the minimum operator will give a composition
 * strategy that computes the shortest path connecting two nodes.
 *  
 *  <p>Usually, strategies require that the two labels provided are of
 *  the same kind (i.e., instances of the same {@link it.unimi.dsi.webgraph.labelling.Label}
 *  class). Moreover, some strategies only accept label of a certain type,
 *  and throw an {@link java.lang.IllegalArgumentException} if the type
 *  is wrong.
