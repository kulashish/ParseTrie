/** A set of attributes that can be used to decorate a node or
 *  an arc of a graph. Attributes appear in the form of &lt;<var>key</var>,<var>value</var>&gt;
 *  pairs, where keys are of type {@link String}. Among attributes,
 *  one (called the <em>well-known attribute</em>), has a special status:
 *  its key can be obtained by using the {@link #wellKnownAttributeKey()} method.
 *  
 *  <p>Values associated to attributes can be anything: the value can be 
 *  obtained (in the form of an object) with {@link #get(String)}.
 *  If the value is of primitive type, the alternative type-specific method
 *  (e.g., {@link #getInt(String)}, or {@link #getChar(String)}) can be
 *  called, with the proviso that such methods may throw an {@link java.lang.IllegalArgumentException}
 *  if the attribute type can not be converted to the one specified without loss of information.
 *  
 *  <p>The value of the well-known attribute can be obtained with {@link #get()},
 *  or with the appropriate type-specific version of the method.
 * 
 *  <h2>Serialisation</h2>
 *  
 *  <p>Implementations must provide {@link #toBitStream(OutputBitStream, int)} and {@link #fromBitStream(InputBitStream, int)}
 *  methods that serialise to a bitstream and deserialise to a bitstream a label, respectively. Since
 *  {@link #fromBitStream(InputBitStream, int)} has no length information, the label format must
 *  be self-delimiting. This can be obtained with a fixed length scheme (see, e.g., {@link FixedWidthIntLabel}),
 *  or using self-delimiting codes (see, e.g., {@link GammaCodedIntLabel}).
 *  
 *  <p>The methods {@link #toBitStream(OutputBitStream,int)} 
 *  and {@link #fromBitStream(InputBitStream,int)} are given as an additional information the number of source
 *  node of the arc over which this label is put. They may use this information to decide how the
 *  label should be stored (typically, to do a more clever compression job).
 *  
 *  <p>The advantage of fixed-width labels (i.e., those for which {@link #fixedWidth()} does not return -1)
 *  is that when loading a {@link BitStreamArcLabelledImmutableGraph} with an offset step larger than 1 the position in the bitstream
 *  for the labels of a node can be calculated more quickly, as the computation just requires the outdegree
 *  of the nodes, whereas in general one has to skip in-between labels with an explicit deserialisation.
 *  
 *  <h2>String-based constructors</h2>
 *  
 *  <p>By convention, all concrete classes implementing this interface must follow the {@link ObjectParser} conventions:
 *  in particular, they must provide a constructor accepting strings (either in fixed or variable number) where the first string is the key. 
 *  The constructor must perform data validation and build an instance with a default value (e.g., 0 for numerical labels). The
 *  constructor is used, for instance, by {@link BitStreamArcLabelledImmutableGraph} to instantiate a label prototype.
 *  Finally, the method {@link #toSpec()} must return a string that is accepted by {@link ObjectParser}.
